Resources of the NeDiMAH Ontology (NeMO).

The NeDiMAH Methods Ontology (NeMO) is a comprehensive ontological model of scholarly practice in the arts and humanities, the development of which is undertaken through the ESF Research Network NeDiMAH (http://www.nedimah.eu/).

NeMO is a CIDOC CRM - compliant ontology which explicitly addresses the interplay of factors of agency (actors and goals), process (activities and methods) and resources (information resources, tools, concepts) manifest in the scholarly process. It builds on the results of extensive empirical studies and modelling of scholarly practices performed by the Digital Curation Unit in projects DARIAH (http://www.dariah.eu/) and EHRI (http://www.ehri-project.eu/).

NeMO incorporates existing relevant taxonomies of scholarly methods and tools, such as TaDIRAH, the arts-humanities.net and Oxford taxonomies of ICT methods, DHCommons, CCC-IULA-UPF and DiRT, through appropriate mappings of the concepts defined therein onto a semantic backbone of NeMO concepts. It thus enables combining documentary elements on scholarly practices of different perspectives and using different vocabularies.

The development of NeMO is an on-going project that greatly benefits from the discussions in related workshops and meetings and the generous intellectual contributions of participants. Interested individuals are invited to contact/participate and also to contribute comments through the website of the project:  http://nemo.dcu.gr.
